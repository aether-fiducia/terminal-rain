# terminal-rain
A small rust cli app to impress all your friends.

This is a simple terminal app with no real function. Just clone this repo, enter the project and
run cargo on the crate for your terminal to turn into the matrix.

```
git clone https://github.com/aether-fiducia/terminal-rain.git
cd terminal-rain
cargo run
```
For a graceful shutdown, just hit Ctrl+C and the terminial will clear and leave you with a prompt.

### Enjoy
